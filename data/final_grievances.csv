The tree is planted on the Mount Morenci side of the street and has branches that are now touching the house and the roofing. If it continues to grow, there is a concern for potential damage to the roof and the house, and also a concern for birds and squirrels to have easy access into the eaves of the house. Would someone be able to come out to just prune the tree back so that it is not touching the house or the roof? The tree is absolutely beautiful and we do not want it removed; we simply want a few of the branches cut back a bit.
